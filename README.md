# Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms
I re-upload my works in realizing machine learning algorithms to this repository so that
I dont need to create a new repository every time I start a new algorithm, which is also 
more convenient for me to manage and classify these works. Otherwise I have to specify what
kind of algorithm it is and I can have a list about what have been done, what I am working 
at and what will I do in the future.

## Motivation about the project
I am doing this because I am not good, maybe not good enough. I learn the machine learning knowledge
in many ways and I didn't learn them scientifically. Thus, I always find that I know the algorithm but
I cannot tell details about it and I don't really how does it work. To solve the problem, also record 
my learnning curve and what I have learnt during the process, I decide to do this and hope I can keep 
working on it and make it a good project.

## What have been done:
### Supervised Learning
1\ [KNN](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/KNN)

2\ [Linear Regression](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/LinearRegression)

3\ [Random Forest](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/RandomForest)

### Unsupervised Learning
1\ [K-means](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning/K-means)

2\ [PCA](https://github.com/ppxwdy/Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning/PCA)
