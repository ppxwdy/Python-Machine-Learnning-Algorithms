# Python-Machine-Learnning-Algorithms
I re-upload my works in realizing machine learning algorithms to this repository so that
I dont need to create a new repository every time I start a new algorithm, which is also 
more convenient for me to manage and classify these works. Otherwise I have to specify what
kind of algorithm it is and I can have a list about what have been done, what I am working 
at and what will I do in the future.

## What have been done:
### Supervised Learning
1\ KNN

2\ Linear Regression

3\ Random Forest

### Unsupervised Learning
1\ K-means

2\ PCA
